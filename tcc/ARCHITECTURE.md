# Fraud API architecture

## Scope

The Java service owns dataset ingestion, medallion persistence, orchestration of
fraud scoring through Kafka, query APIs and human review. It does not train or
execute the machine-learning model.

## Dependency direction

```text
adapter/in (HTTP, Batch, scheduler, Kafka consumer)
                  |
                  v
application/port/in -> application/service -> application/domain
                  |
                  v
application/port/out
                  ^
                  |
adapter/out (PostgreSQL, file storage, Kafka producer)
```

Application ports do not expose JPA entities, Spring Data `Page` objects,
`MultipartFile` or Kafka classes. Controllers translate transport data into
application commands, and persistence adapters translate domain objects into
entities.

## Main patterns

- Hexagonal architecture for dependency inversion.
- Strategy + Factory for CSV/XLS/XLSX readers.
- Spring Batch Reader/Processor/Writer for chunked and restartable imports.
- Repository adapters for each medallion responsibility.
- MapStruct for compile-time mapping between domain objects and JPA entities.
- Transactional Outbox for reliable Silver-to-Kafka publication.
- Specification Factory for composable optional Gold filters.
- Domain methods for explicit entity state transitions instead of public setters.
- Global exception handler for a consistent HTTP error contract.

## Import flow

```text
POST /imports
  -> validate command
  -> store file and calculate SHA-256
  -> reject duplicate active/completed import
  -> create ops.import_job (QUEUED)
  -> launch datasetImportJob asynchronously
  -> read CSV/XLS/XLSX with the matching strategy
  -> normalize names and values
  -> write raw row to Bronze
  -> write normalized row to Silver or quarantine it in ops
  -> register the detected schema
  -> enqueue a scoring event in the transactional outbox
  -> publish pending outbox events to Kafka
```

The `importId + sheet + row` tuple produces a deterministic transaction ID.
Restarts therefore do not create a second claim.

## Fraud label semantics

The confirmed fraud column is optional. Its accepted aliases are configured by
`IMPORT_TARGET_ALIASES`.

- Missing target: `confirmedFraud = null` (unknown).
- Accepted positive label: `confirmedFraud = true`.
- Accepted negative label: `confirmedFraud = false`.
- Invalid target value: the row is quarantined with its original data.

Columns not recognized as the target are preserved as features. Adding a new
column does not require a Java code or database schema change.

## Medallion responsibilities

| Schema | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `bronze` | Immutable original rows and detected column registry. |
| `silver` | Normalized, queryable claims and confirmed labels. |
| `gold` | Model score, risk level, model version and explanation. |
| `ops` | Import state, rejected rows and transactional outbox. |
| `review` | Immutable human review history. |
| `ml` | Model metadata prepared for later Python integration. |

JSONB keeps attributes dynamic while fixed operational columns preserve
traceability and indexing. Flyway owns all schemas; Hibernate only validates
the mapping.

## HTTP API

| Method | Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `POST` | `/imports` | Upload CSV/XLS/XLSX and enqueue a batch job. |
| `GET` | `/imports` | List import jobs. |
| `GET` | `/imports/{id}` | Read progress and final status. |
| `POST` | `/imports/{id}/retry` | Restart a failed Spring Batch execution. |
| `GET` | `/imports/{id}/schema` | Read dynamic columns, types and roles. |
| `GET` | `/imports/{id}/errors` | Read quarantined rows. |
| `GET` | `/claims` | Query normalized claims with server pagination. |
| `GET` | `/claims/{transactionId}` | Read a normalized claim. |
| `POST` | `/claims/{transactionId}/reviews` | Confirm fraud, legitimacy or inconclusive status. |
| `GET` | `/dashboard/summary` | Read aggregate counters. |
| `GET` | `/dashboard/results` | Query Gold scoring results. |

Dynamic claim filters use `field` and `value`; field names are restricted to
normalized identifiers and values are always bound SQL parameters.

## Import status

```text
QUEUED -> PROCESSING -> COMPLETED
                    -> COMPLETED_WITH_WARNINGS
                    -> FAILED
```

The file hash prevents accidental re-import of an active or completed file.
Failed files may be submitted again.

## Local configuration

Relevant environment variables:

- `DB_URL`, `DB_USERNAME`, `DB_PASSWORD`
- `KAFKA_BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS`
- `KAFKA_TRANSACTIONS_TOPIC`, `KAFKA_RESULTS_TOPIC`
- `IMPORT_STORAGE_PATH`
- `IMPORT_MAX_FILE_SIZE`
- `IMPORT_TARGET_ALIASES`
- `OUTBOX_PUBLISH_DELAY_MS`

Run validation with:

```bash
./mvnw clean verify
```
